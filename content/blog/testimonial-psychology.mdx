**Testimonials work because they tap into human psychology.**

Here’s why customer proof is so persuasive:

---

## 1️⃣ Social Proof Bias

> *“If others trust them, I can too.”*

Humans follow the crowd — especially when uncertain.

---

## 2️⃣ Authority Transfer

Testimonials borrow authority from satisfied customers, signaling:

- Trustworthiness
- Credibility
- Quality

---

## 3️⃣ Similarity Effect

Seeing people "just like me" succeed makes prospects:

- Relate easier
- Envision success
- Reduce perceived risk

---

## 4️⃣ Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)

- You might miss out

This drives action.
