        "overall": "Jira is very simple to use so the learning curve is not a problem. It has been used by tens of thousands of users and its maturity makes it very versatile.\nAlthough it seems like a simple solution due to its look and feel, Jira allows you to manage complex workflows in heterogeneous environments and with multiple departments.\nThe reports are quite complete and its Dashboard presents reliable analytics that offers visibility to members of the organization responsible for decision making.",
        "pros_text": "With Jira we do not need to worry about making a personalized configuration, since we have multiple templates and this is vital to start quick and reliable planning.\nIt takes care of the basic configuration and then we can assign resources, customize roles and privileges, and make sure people see what they need.\nAnother incredible advantage is its mobile APP that guarantees monitoring outside the organization and allows us to always stay connected.",
        "cons_text": "Jira allows us to start with an unlicensed model to carry out tests and ensure that its use is what we really need, but after that we must consider that the licensed version is necessary for constant growth in our organization, so it is also important to consider the number of users that we are going to have to license for a successful implementation, and if we can afford it, we will have an excellent platform in our organization.",
