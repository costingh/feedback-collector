				"What do you like best about Postman?\nHaving utilized Postman for over a year and a half as a backend developer, I can attest to its indispensable role in my backend development journey.\n\nPostman has been a support for me in backend development. Its intuitive interface made it easy for me to dive in, even as a beginner. I find myself using it frequently for everything from basic API testing to advanced tasks like WebSocket and gRPC integration. Postman's simplicity and reliability make it my go-to tool every day, whether I'm working solo or collaborating with teammates.\n\nOne more thing is you're capable of creating environmental variable in collection scope and global scope. So, no need to changing values on multiple places.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Postman?\nWhile it was easy to use, but there is a downside that the documentation is not user friendly for begginer. In the beginning when I had to read the documentation regarding Mock test, it was somehow difficult to understand what the writer wants to say. I had to take the help of available blogs on other sites.\nPlease update the documentation and make it simple.\n\nWhat problems is Postman solving and how is that benefiting you?\nThe main problem it solved it you can test the APIs smoothly with a better UI interface, and can create and share the collection with teammates easily.",

				'What do you like best about Postman?\nPostman is a very simplified tool to execute API requests and their different operations like GET, PUT and POST. It is very easy to install and also learn, even for a new user. We use it almost thrice a week to execute different REST and SOAP APIs using JSON and XML request formats, and then validate the responses.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Postman?\nNow, Postman has made its services chargeable, with licenses, if you want to save the existing requests in workspaces. So, that is one issue. Other than that, rest everything is fine.\n\nWhat problems is Postman solving and how is that benefiting you?\nPostman is a very good tool to accomplish API request and response validations. Moreover, this also helps in testing API automation, with tools like Selenium to verify if the API endpoint is returning correct values or not. Instead of worrying about the slow load of front-end applications, it is easier to just validate the backend services of APIs using Postman, hence that saves a lot of time and effort.',

Also it is very easy to implement and access . It is easy to integrate in system as have to download and and registser. One major use of postman is colection of api. I can make different colection of my api. And while debugging it is very helpful.If i talk about custmor support , application actually good ,so  i do not took help as of now. But i feel it definatelygood for custmor.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Postman?\nAnother issue which i face is due frequent use of that application may crash application and it through out of the application.\n\nWhat problems is Postman solving and how is that benefiting you?\nPostman help me to solve and debug existing bug in my existing api. Also it help to design new api . It save my time for debugging as i already have api and collection with me on postman. So i can figure out any application issue by use of that.Also it helps to developers to manage multipke environment  such as development, staging and production and switch between then very easily.',

				"What do you like best about Postman?\nHaving utilized Postman for over a year and a half as a backend developer, I can attest to its indispensable role in my backend development journey.\n\nPostman has been a support for me in backend development. Its intuitive interface made it easy for me to dive in, even as a beginner. I find myself using it frequently for everything from basic API testing to advanced tasks like WebSocket and gRPC integration. Postman's simplicity and reliability make it my go-to tool every day, whether I'm working solo or collaborating with teammates.\n\nOne more thing is you're capable of creating environmental variable in collection scope and global scope. So, no need to changing values on multiple places.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Postman?\nWhile it was easy to use, but there is a downside that the documentation is not user friendly for begginer. In the beginning when I had to read the documentation regarding Mock test, it was somehow difficult to understand what the writer wants to say. I had to take the help of available blogs on other sites.\nPlease update the documentation and make it simple.\n\nWhat problems is Postman solving and how is that benefiting you?\nThe main problem it solved it you can test the APIs smoothly with a better UI interface, and can create and share the collection with teammates easily.",

We use it almost thrice a week to execute different REST and SOAP APIs using JSON and XML request formats, and then validate the responses.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Postman?\nNow, Postman has made its services chargeable, with licenses, if you want to save the existing requests in workspaces. So, that is one issue. Other than that, rest everything is fine.\n\nWhat problems is Postman solving and how is that benefiting you?\nPostman is a very good tool to accomplish API request and response validations. Moreover, this also helps in testing API automation, with tools like Selenium to verify if the API endpoint is returning correct values or not. Instead of worrying about the slow load of front-end applications, it is easier to just validate the backend services of APIs using Postman, hence that saves a lot of time and effort.',

			review_content:
				'What do you like best about Postman?\nWithin Postman, users have the ability to construct new API collections. They can also test all four kinds of APIsâ€”get, put, post, and deleteâ€”to get the response they need.\n\nPostman is an open-source platform that allows users to test and manage APIs. It includes several functionalities.\nWhen it comes to testing APIs and their responses, Postman is a lifesaver for users.\n\nWhat do you dislike about Postman?\nIn my opinion, Postman is the best tool currently available for dealing with APIs since it satisfies the demands of customers on a daily basis and allows them to have a single platform that handles all of this.\n\nIn conclusion, the most significant issues I have with Postman include the complexity of its more sophisticated functionality and the lack of current documentation.\n\nI believe that Postman has room to grow in these areas to provide an even better experience for its users.\n\nWhat problems is Postman solving and how is that benefiting you?\nI use Postman on a daily basis and like using it to test and connect with APIs.\nPostman is compatible with several API types, such as REST and SOAP which helps me to be more productive.',
